# Development Plan
This document will describe how the development is supposed to happen and all of its stages

## Part 1 - Simple Standalone Phase

### Apps In This Phase
🍞 Toast - Time Tracking
🍳 Omelette - Kanban Board
🥞 Pancake - Notes/Journaling
🥣 Cereal - Scheduling
🥛 Yogurt - Task Management
☕ Espresso - Focus Timer

### What to Expect

This phase of development is meant to develop an understanding of Javsacript and its eco-system.
All apps in the app list should be developed as standalone web apps, without any requirement for fancy visuals, The following tools should be used.

- [ ] Pure Javascript
- [ ] HTML
- [ ] CSS

The intent of this phase is to get familiar mainly with Javascript, CSS here is not a priority, and won't be for the rest of this project.
It is expected that we learn how Javascript works and how it interacts with the web.

## Part 2 - Database integration

### Apps In This Phase
🍞 Toast - Time Tracking
🍳 Omelette - Kanban Board
🥞 Pancake - Notes/Journaling
🥛 Yogurt - Task Management

### What to Expect

This phase sould teach how to integrate Javascript web apps with a Database of your choice for the sake of keeping the needed user data.
Users expect to see what they created to still be there when they close and open the app again, Only the apps that need to keep data are included in this phase.
The following tools should be used on top of the ones used last phase.

- [ ] SQL
- [ ] A database of your choosing
- [ ] An ORM if really really needed

## Part 3 - Framework(ing) time

### Apps In This Phase
🍞 Toast - Time Tracking
🍳 Omelette - Kanban Board
🥞 Pancake - Notes/Journaling
🥣 Cereal - Scheduling
🥛 Yogurt - Task Management
☕ Espresso - Focus Timer

### What to Expect

It is time to choose a framework. Its true, we can code this in pure JS, but frameworks are here to help so don't be afraid to learn one.
In this example we will be choosing React, but you can pick any. Its important to focus on your choice and understand it well.

- [ ] Your framework of choice

## Part 4 - Lets make styling easy

### Apps In This Phase
🍞 Toast - Time Tracking
🍳 Omelette - Kanban Board
🥞 Pancake - Notes/Journaling
🥣 Cereal - Scheduling
🥛 Yogurt - Task Management
☕ Espresso - Focus Timer

### What to Expect

Styling web apps can be a lot of fun, however the goal of this project is not learning advanced CSS techniques, frameworks and libraries, this is why this stage focusses on tools that will speed up the styling process, we'll use tools that gives us a lot of pre-baked components that we can tweak for our liking.
